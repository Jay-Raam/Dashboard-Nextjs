## Problems & Solutions 

Problem 1: Performance Optimization
Challenge: Ensuring the dashboard remains responsive and performs well as the volume of data increases.

Solution: Used server-side pagination and optimized MongoDB queries to handle large datasets efficiently. Combined with client-side caching and efficient data fetching strategies, these techniques ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
